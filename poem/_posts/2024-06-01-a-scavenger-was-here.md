residues of a dead fantasy  
hopes of the hopeless  
for dreams once  
foretold, by her fountainhead  

aloof, hands astride, she stood about  
ten meters afar her loot  
she turns left and mutters  
i have trodden this road before  

and here too as she turns right.  
the path before her  
still thrills from the pain it caused  
her soles yesterday  

a scavenger stands still  
with nowhere to turn to, she flies away.  
all the holy grails of her  
progenitor are dead?
