in this small world of mine  
where crystals beam  
and melody flickers  

i have come a long way  
to be availed just the  
pittance to decipher when  
the birds sing for joy  
and when they cry for freedom  
for i have done all but defeat the gods  
that i still have engraved in my  
bucket list  
and that i shall come to fruition  
in a s√©ance  

times like these are  
when i sit and filter  
what i got and what got me  
and let the dew lull on my skin
