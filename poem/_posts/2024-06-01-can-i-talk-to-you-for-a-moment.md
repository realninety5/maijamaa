do we still talk like we used to  
like we ought to  
if there was a yardstick for that  
these days, i speak and i listen  
you speak and you listen  
a monologue stricken  
can we ever get a dialogue  
when we only listen to ourselves  
can we ever push forward  
when i always resort to internal monologue  
and you soliloquies  
even when the bottle spills  
our egos triumphs, still  
and here, my consciousness streams
