lilac and sands  
palms and groove  
my flames falter  
the story goes thus  

how time flies  
and how we go from  
a smile to existential dichotomy  
and not know from whence it came  

life like a vending machine  
on and on, it spins into  
existence, a whirlwind that sweeps you off your feet  
or maybe wind you up in the warmth of june  

i could regale you with  
my anecdote or my legend  
i could be nothing but a dying mirage  
but i can not make you lead life through my binoculars
