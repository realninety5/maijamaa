it's april again and my mind  
like the sun  
has been shadowed by the thought of you,  
the eclipse above me  

but my self-image dwindle  
always in constant doubt  
of where my true feeling lies  
for one, in affair, i go unnoticed  

if this is what love entails  
i seek to know why it has lingered  
this long, at which alter it began  
and the last one to truly love 

yet, if i ever stumble  
pray it be into the embrace that heals  
and the gaze that feels  
the splendour i have got in my heart to give
