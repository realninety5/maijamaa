### My story


Kingsley Godwin here! I’m a passionate software developer by day and moonlight as a poetic dreamer by night. When I'm not knee-deep in code, you can find me scribbling verses about life, love, and everything in between. Writing poems adds a touch of artistry to my tech-filled world.

Learning new things is my jam—whether it's picking up a new programming language, exploring a new hobby, or simply daydreaming about another 'why/how'. Curiosity fuels my journey, and I'm always on the lookout for the next exciting challenge.

Join me as I navigate the realms of software development and poetic musings. Let's code, create, and dream together!
